        description = """\
The `talos_machine_disks` data source has been updated to use the better CEL expression language.
The resource attributes and selector have been updated to use the new syntax.
The user would need to update the data source in their configuration to use the new syntax.
The expression syntax is documented in the [CEL documentation](https://www.talos.dev/latest/talos-guides/configuration/disk-management/#disk-selector).

This also brings in consistency with how disks are reported in Talos.
